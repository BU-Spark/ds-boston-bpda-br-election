## Project Proposal

### Title: Brazilian Immigrant Participation in Brazil-Held Election Results

### Team Members
- Wiley Hunt (whunt1965)
- Chen Feng (cefeng9988)
- John Bestavros (Johannes2755)
- Jerry Zhang (jzhang12)

### Project Description
Project seeks to understand voting patterns of Brazilian immigrants in Brazil elections and the composition of the Brazilian immigrant electorate. We hope to understand changing patterns among Brazilian immigrants that vote in Brazilian elections and what community or environmental factors may influence voting patterns.

Pending the success of Brazilian data analysis, look at similar patterns and trends for Haitan Immigrants and Haiti-held elections as well as Dominican Republic Immigrants and Dominican Republic-held elections.
 
Contextual Note: Immigrants living in the US (or outside their home country) can still vote in national elections.

### Key Questions to be Answered
- How are voting/electorate patterns different among Brazilian immigrants residing in different countries (eg, US vs Japan)?
- How have voting patterns/electorate populations changed over time?
- What decisions are made differently with changing voting patterns?

### Limitations
- Looking at the data set, it appears that new features (e.g. age, marital status, etc) have been added over time. Thus, the features present in each of the datasets may vary by year, which may make it difficult to analyze how these features have changed over time. 
- There appears to be some variance in how "location" (or municipality) of voters is defined in the different datasets (for example, the 1998 dataset appears to only identify the countries in which voters live, but later datasets break down this data into major cities/regions within a country). Likely, we should be able to resolve these differences through some data cleaning, but it is worth noting.
- This is very minor, but some of the earlier datasets contain entries from countries which have since been renamed or split into multiple countries (eg, Yugoslavia). We will need to figure out how to deal with these entries as we analyze trends over time. 
- We have been advised by the client to avoid making causal inferences
- We have been advised by the client that there is limited interest in regression/predictive analyses 

### Deliverables
- Final presentation/report describing methodology and findings
- Visualizations of Data Analysis
