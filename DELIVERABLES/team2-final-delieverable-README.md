## How to run

##### Objective: Reproduce our results
- Run 'python3 convertToCountry.py` to create the files that end in "_processed.csv" in the folder "election data"
- Run 'python3 sum_US_JPN.py` to create the file "sum_votes_US_JPN.csv" in the folder "election data"
- Run 'python3 votes_over_time.py` to create the file "sum_party_votes.csv" in the folder "election data"

Note: These commands have already been run and their outputs saved in folder "election data"

##### Objective: Compile and use our codebase
- Our code does not need to be compiled
- To recreate our diagrams, install jupyter notebooks and run "Delieverable3VotingPatterns.ipynb", "VotingPatternsGraphs.ipynb", and "VotingUSJPNPatternsGraphs.ipynb" to generate the corresponding graphs

Note: These graphs have already been created and their outputs saved in folder "images"

##### Objective: Navigate our dataset
- All our data is stored in csv files in the folder "election data"
