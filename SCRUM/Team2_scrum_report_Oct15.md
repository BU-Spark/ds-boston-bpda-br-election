# Scrum Report - 10/15/2021

## Questions

### What have I worked on?
So far Team 2 has submited Deliverable 0, begun reviewing the dataset provided by Hugh and we are working on deciding how to manipulate/clean the dataset to answer the target questions.

### What will I be working on next?
Up next, we will take a deeper look into the data provided by Hugh and start planning on which target questions are answerable given our Election dataset.
We hope to be able to start assigning initial tasks to begin the project and start on Deliverable 1.

### Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
We have not run into any issues yet.

### Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
Our next meeting with the clients is on (10/22).
