# Scrum Report - 10/8/2021
## By John (Wiley) Hunt

## Questions

### What have I worked on?
Thus far, I have simply reviewed the project decsription and perused the dataset (which was provided today). I have also put together a collaborate Google doc for deliverable 0.

### What will I be working on next?
First, I will work with the team to finalize and publish deliverable 0. Next, I will speak with the team about deliverable 1 and we can assign tasks. For example, if it would be helpful, I can work on providing some translations (Portuguese to English) for the dataset as several features (eg, region/country are in Portuguese) and we may want those in English for later on. 

### Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
Nothing yet.

### Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
We met the client today (10/8) and have another meeting in 2 weeks (10/22).
