# Scrum Report - 10/8/2021

## Questions

### What have I worked on?
So far we have attended our Friday 9am EST meeting with Hugh and Alvaro, reviewed the election project description, created/contributed to the collaborative Google doc for deliverable 0, and begun reviewing the dataset provided by Hugh.

### What will I be working on next?
Up next, we will work as a team on finalizing our deliverable 0 and submitting it. We will then take a deeper look into the data provided by Hugh and see if there are any preliminary questions. Afterwards, we will begin assigning initial tasks to begin the project. 

### Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
We have not run into any issues yet.

### Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
We met the client today (10/8) and have another meeting in 2 weeks (10/22).
