# Team 2 Scrum Report - 10/22/2021

## Questions

### What have I worked on?
In the past week, we have worked on the following:
- Filtered the Election datasets and created a new CSV with the sum of votes from 
  each political party in each year. This will be used to analyze how voting
  participation has changed over time and if there are any trends.
- Researching possible tools to convert cities into their country, we need this
  to clean our datasets after 2010 since we are given cities rather than countries.

### What will I be working on next?
Up next, we will be working on the following:
- Graphing the voting participation over time CSV
- Answering 2 of our key questions
- Determining potential limits
- Converting cities to countries
- Submit Deliverable 1 by 11/01

### Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
We do not currently have any issues.

### Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
We met the client this week (10/22) and have another meeting in two weeks (11/05).
